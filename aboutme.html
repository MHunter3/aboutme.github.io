<p class="col-sm-8"><b>My name is Morgan Hunter and I am from Sacramento, CA. <br> I currently live in Lake County, California and I am looking to become a Campaign Developer for Raisely.  I am currently in school for web and mobile application development; therefore, I am not an expert but I am always learning. <wbr> I love programming and combining HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript together. I have experience working as an account manager and have managed over 100 accounts in my territory and I should have no problem managing my own customers.</b> Please see resume for more details.

	<h1>Questions</h1>

	<dl>
		<dt><b>Why would I be a good fit for the Campaign Developer role?</b><dt>
			<dd>I believe that I would be a great fit for the Campaign Developer role because my skills match the job requirements and I firmly believe that Raisely shares the same passion as I.  We take pride in the work that we do and will not stop until the client is satisfied with their desired outcome.  I believe that I would blend in well with the team.</dd>
			<br>
		<dt><b>Why do you want to work here over somewhere else?</b><dt>
			<dd>I have had my eyes on Raisely for a while now. I like that Raisely helps people make their dreams come true whether that be for startups, established organizations, or causes of other sizes. Raisely is a company that takes great pride in helping others and that is the best type of work you can do given our short time here on earth.</dd>
			<dl>
			<br>
		<dt><b>List of Tasks</b><dt>
			<dd><b>Tasks I am excited about</b></dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Brainstorming how to add a unique campaign requirement into Raisely, with only a day to complete it.  <i>The reason for is because I love the challenge of tight deadlines but also enjoy communicating with my coworkers about solving problems.  I cannot wait to do this!</i></li>
				<br>
				<li>Running a SQL report to find which customers you should check-in with. <i>Good customer service is the key to success. Periodic check-ins are a great way to ensure that customers are satisfied and it also lets them know that <b>we</b> are here for them. Their success is our success.</i></li>
			</ul>
			<dd><b>Tasks I would like to learn</b></dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating a complex, multi-step signup form using Create React App, Stripe Payments and our API. <i>This sounds really exciting.  I have never used React App; however, I know this is something I could learn fairly quickly.  The key word in their is <b>complex</b> which tells me it might be a challenge and I love a programming challenge.</i></li>
				<br>
				<li>Running a scoping call with a customer to figure out all the details about their campaign. <i> I have experience with this as the customer.  My current job we have campaign/project leaders that ask the team about our projects and I have always admired the questions they ask. They know how to steer us in the right direction.  I would like to learn more about how to ask these types of "fact gathering" questions to ensure the customer is able to reach their goals.</i></li>
			</ul>

			<dd><b>Tasks I would <u>not</u> like to learn or do</b></dd>
			<ul>
				<li>I can honestly say that there is not one thing on this list that does not excite me. However, I can address some areas that may give me imposter syndrome. <b>**Project managing the set-up of a new large campaign on Raisely, keeping it on time and budget**</b><i>The reason I would feel imposter syndrome here is because I have do not have much experience with budgeting other than what I do for my own personal finances.  If I were to venture a guess, perhaps an excel spreadsheet can help to make sure the campaign does not go over the budget.</i></li>
				<br>
				<li>Building a special kind of campaign leaderboard as a component in React.  <i>I am not quite sure what this is exactly; however, I am sure I could figure it out and knock it out of the park.</i></li>
			</ul>
